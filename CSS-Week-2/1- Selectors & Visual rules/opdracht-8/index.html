      <h1>Cascade</h1>
     <p> Cascade implies  that the order of CSS rules matter; 
       <br>when two rules apply that have equal specificity the one 
       <br>that comes last in the CSS is the one that will be used.
       <br><br>
       <p>In this example, we have two rules that could apply to the h1. 
        <br>The h1 ends up being colored blue even though the first h1 
      selector is set to red</p>
      <br><br>
     <h1>Inheritance</h1>
     <p> Inheritance means that some CSS properties by default 
      <br>inherit values set on the current element's parent element, 
      <br>and some don't. This can also cause some behavior that 
      <br>you might not expect.</p>
      <p> Some CSS property values set on parent elements are 
        <br>inherited by their child elements, and some aren't.
        <br>For example, if you set a color and font-family on an element, 
       <br>every element inside it will also be styled with that color 
       <br>and font, <span>you've applied different color and font values directly 
        <br>to them. by using for instance a span element</span> </p>
