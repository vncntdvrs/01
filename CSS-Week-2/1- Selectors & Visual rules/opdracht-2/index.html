      <h1>CSS Syntax</h1><br>
      <p>A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.<br>
        
        <br><br>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
        <br><br>The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
        <br><br>Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
        <br><br>Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</p>
