    <h1>Static</h1>
    <p>The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. 
    <br>The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect. 
    <br>This is the default value.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Relative</h1>
    <p>The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, 
    <br>and then offset relative to itself </p>
<br>
    <h1>Absolute</h1>
    <p>The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created 
    <br>for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to its closest 
    <br>positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial 
    <br>containing block.</p>
<br>
    <h1>Fixed</h1>
    <p>The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for 
    <br>the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to the initial containing 
    <br>block established by the viewport, </p>
<br>
    <h1>Sticky</h1>
    <p>The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset 
    <br>relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor and containing block (nearest block-level ancestor), 
    <br>including table-related elements, based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left. 
    <br>The offset does not affect the position of any other elements.</p>
